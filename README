NAME
    Dpchrist::File::LimitPath - limit path lengths

DESCRIPTION
    This documentation describes module revision $Revision: 1.8 $.

    This is alpha test level software and may change or disappear at any
    time.

  SUBROUTINES
   limit_path
        limit_path LIST

    Checks path length of each item in LIST and shortens file names to keep
    path length less than or equal to a prescribed limit (default 220). If a
    list item is a directory, processes contained files recursively. Returns
    true (1).

    Prints the names of shortened files. Use the "-quiet" option to
    suppress.

    Options may be set via %Dpchrist::File::LimitPath::opt:

    -delete => [0|1]
        Delete files that are too long but can't be shortened. Delete files
        that, if renamed, would collide with other files (previously
        existing or another renamed file).

    -dry_run => [0|1]
        Check files, but don't rename any.

    -limit => LIMIT
        Maximum path length in characters. Must be between the longest LIST
        item length and 32767 (inclusive).

    -quiet => [0|1]
        Only output error messages.

    Calls Carp::confess() on errors, including:

    *   LIST is empty.

    *   -limit option is less than longest list item length.

    *   Shortening file name would reduce file name to less than 1 character
        plus tilde plus dot plus extension. Use the "-delete" option to
        delete such files instead.

    *   Shortening file name would result in a file name collision. Use the
        "-delete" option to delete such files instead.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

    All of the subroutines may be imported by using the ':all' tag:

        use Dpchrist::File::LimitPath    qw( :all );

    See 'perldoc Export' for everything in between.
